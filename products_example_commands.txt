1. Get cluster status info

GET
_status

2. A darn simple products query - show everything!

POST products/product/_search
{
   "query": {
      "match_all": {}
   }
}

3. Add another product!

PUT products/product/99
{
  "department_name": "Cameras",
  "department_name_analyzed": "Cameras",
  "department_id": 3,
  "name": "Nikon D4 16.2 MP CMOS FX Digital SLR",
  "description": "This new flagship D-SLR offers speed and accuracy with a 16.2 MP FX-format CMOS sensor, 10/11 fps continuous shooting, a 91,000-Pixel RGB sensor and Advanced SRS, improved 51 point AF System, ISO expanded to 204,800 and 1080p video at 30p with stereo sound.",
  "price": 609999
}

3.5 explicit GET

GET products/product/99

4. Look again - the D4 should be listed now.

POST products/product/_search
{
   "query": {
      "match_all": {}
   }
}

5. OK, scrolling through all the products is silly - this thing is for searching right?  Search for everything in the Cameras products category

POST products/product/_search
{
   "query": {
      "match": {
          "department_name_analyzed": "camera"
      }
   }
}

6. What happens when searching against the non-analyzed department name field?

POST products/product/_search
{
   "query": {
      "match": {
          "department_name": "camera"
      }
   }
}

7. A query with multiple criteria - 'bool', not 'match':
POST products/product/_search
{
   "query": {
      "bool": {
        "must": [
          { "term" : {"department_name" : "Books"} },
          { "term" : {"description" : "religion"} }
        ]
      }
   }
}
